# Project Title: Collaborative Drawing Board (Test Version)

## Overview
This project is a **drawing board application** inspired by tools like **Excalidraw**. It leverages **WebRTC** technology for real-time collaboration. The project is currently undergoing testing and has certain features temporarily disabled for assessment purposes.

### âš  Caution:
**NEVER PUSH YOUR CODE** to any repository. Submissions must follow the specified guidelines, or you will fail the assessment.

## Project Goals
This project serves as an assessment for both **Blockchain Skills** and **Full-stack Development Skills**.

### 1. Blockchain Skill Assessment
- **Task**: Deploy an NFT smart contract on the **Ethereum Testnet**.
- **IPFS Integration**: Store NFT images using **NFT.Storage** (or your own implementation for IPFS storage).
- **MINT Feature**: After drawing, clicking the **"MINT"** button should mint the drawing as an **NFT**.

**Requirements**:
- Smart contract deployed on Ethereum Testnet.
- Proper NFT storage configuration using **NFT.Storage** or equivalent.

**Deliverable**:
- Submit the **transaction hash** of the minted NFT token.

### 2. Full-stack Skill Assessment
- **Task**: Connect the socket and print `socket connected` and drawing status(coursor movement) in the terminal.
- **Current State**: We're using a socket for synchronizing the drawing status, but currently, the socket is not functioning.

**Deliverable**:
- upload `screenshot` of your terminal with `drawing board`

## Features
- **Solo Drawing Mode** (Working)
- **NFT Minting** (Temporarily Disabled for Testing)
- **Public Collaboration Mode** (Needs Fixing)

---

## Dependencies & Tools
- **WebRTC**: For real-time drawing collaboration.
- **Ethereum Testnet**: For deploying the NFT smart contract.
- **NFT.Storage**: For IPFS-based image storage.


**Good Luck!**
